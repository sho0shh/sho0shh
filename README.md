Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Jesse, a budding cyber security enthusiast currently preparing to start formal studies in this exciting field.
Here, I document and showcase my independent projects and learning journey as I delve deeper into the realm of cybersecurity.

My primary goal is to develop practical skills in cybersecurity while awaiting the commencement of my formal studies. Through these projects, I aim to:
Gain hands-on experience in specific areas of interest, e.g., network security, ethical hacking, cryptography.
Strengthen my understanding of specific technologies or tools, e.g., penetration testing frameworks, encryption algorithms.
Build a portfolio that reflects my capabilities and growth in the field.
